     <h1>welcome to my portfolio</h1>
      
     <h2>about this page</h2>
      <p>
        This is my first portfolio website created using only HTML.
        It is part of my learning journey in web development.
      </p>
 
      <h3>Why I Am Learning Web Development</h3>
      <p>
        I want to learn how websites are built and how the web works.
        HTML is the function of every website on the internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        This page demonestrates the basic structure of a valid HTML document.
        It includes headings, paragraphs, and an image.
      </p>

      <p>
        As i continue learning, I will improve this portfolio with more content and better design using css and javaScript.
      </p>
